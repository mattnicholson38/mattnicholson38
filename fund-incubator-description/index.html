                <h1 class="display-5">What is a mutual fund incubator?</h1>
                <br><p class="lead">A mutual fund incubator is simply a group of mutual funds
                launched at the same time.  They typically are open only to employees or a very limited number
                of inside investors and generally supported by financial backing from the host company.  
                A mutual fund or hedge fund company can start an incubator for a number of legitimate reasons,
                such as to test out new or risky investment strategies.
                New managers can also hone there skills in a relatively safe and less public manner compared
                to managing a public mutual fund that is open to investor and regulator scrutiny.  This practice protects 
                ordinary investors from investing in methodoligies that prove unsound or with
                investment managers that turn out to have poor judgement.  Funds can remain in incubation for 
                anywhere from 3 months to several years.</p>
                <p class="lead">So in principle the reasoning behind incubators is sound.  
                The flaw in the process comes when the funds are finally launched and made available to the general public.
                Quite naturally, investment companies launch only the funds that do better than their
                competitors or benchmarks and unceremoneously bury the incubator failures.  Again, nothing
                particluarly nefarious about this behaviour, except that by ignoring the losers and only
                promoting ("talking about") the winners, the mutual fund industry is taking advantage of survivorship bias.
                This technique is deceptive because by only focusing on the incubator survivors the company
                is attempting to show that they have special insight or skill that allows them to beat
                the averages, aka, index funds. The reality is that even stocks randomly distributed into the
                funds of mutual fund incubator will produce a fund or two that "outperforms."</p> 
                <p class="lead">True outperformance would only be shown 
                if all the funds in the incubator as an aggregate average beat the index.  
                In that case, then perhaps there is some special skill embodied in
                the winning funds that causes them to pull up the incubator average.  But without being able
                to examine the losers (or even know they exist, in some cases), 
                the average investor cannot tell. To drive this point home, the fund incubators on these pages
                contain stocks chosen by essentially random means.  Simply by statstics - random chance - some
                of these funds will outperform the benchmark averages, which will clearly demonstrate that no special
                skill is required to launch an "above average" fund using an incubator.  As the SEC-mandated disclaimer 
                says: “Past performance is no guarantee of future results.”</p>
                <p class="lead">Note that survivorship bias also improves the performance of active funds
                versus passive funds and should be accounted for when comparing the two types of 
                funds in general.  Vanguard describes their analysis
