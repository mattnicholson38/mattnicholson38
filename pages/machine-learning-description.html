                <p class="lead">Machine Learning algorithms have proliferated widely in recent years,
                though many of them are not new.  Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic have been around
                for at least twenty years.  Advances in computing, data availability, and not the least
                their success in predicting what people want to buy, has lead to their proliferation.  
                Several algorithms have been employed here in a simple manner as an interesting means
                of semi-randomly selecting stocks for the incubators.  The implementation is loosely
                based on the formulation of Nicolas Carbone in Towards Data Science,

                <p class="lead">Each Machine Learning algorithm required training on a significant set of
                data in order to "learn" which stocks are most likely to go up in the following quarter.
                31 quarterly metrics for each stock in the S&P 500 over the 5 years leading up to 2020 
                were used as the training data.  The classification of "success" for the training set
                was defined as any stock that appreciated more than 5 or 6 percent during a quarter,
                with the exact threshold varying for new quarters in order to keep the number of stocks
                selected reasonable.  The trained algorithms were run on the key metrics for the 
                quarter preceding the period of performance and the stocks selected were then included
                in the fund and its performance tracked for that period.  For example, quarterly results
                for 3/31/20 were processed by the trained algorithms to select stocks to hold during the 
                3 months from 4/1/20 to 6/30/20, and so on. See the wikipedia descriptions for
